## What I'm doing now
- Studying has started but I've been pre occupied with preparing for interview, and will have some catching up to do not too long into the term.
  - I am overloading the shit out of next term by taking an extra courses to bring my total up to 8 courses
    - 1 business courses, 1 economics course,  1 info session course, 1 prototyping (30hrs/term) course, 4 core courses
      -  the ECON course has looked like a lot of memorization, while the business course seems like a lot of new interesting possibly difficult to memorize stuff.
  - ~Also trying to do a URA parallelly so that I literally have no time on my hand to do absolutely anything unproductive~
- Devoting some time to projects outside of work before applying to jobs next term [[zephyr](https://github.com/arora-aditya/zephyr)/[sage](http://thesage.co/)]
- I have officially resigned from alI l forms of social media, and will not be giving the tech giants any more data into my browsing habits. No YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit or Google Plus (RIP)
  - UPDATE: the blog post on quitting social media is out: [How Quitting Social Media almost Cost me My Life](https://arora-aditya.com/blogs/social-media/)
  - The review for "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" is live [here](https://books.arora-aditya.com/subtle-art/)
  - Read my next book, Eric Schmidt's new book "The Trillion Dollar Coach", and will be writing the review over the weekend (eh, haven't written yet, but will be soon)

## Quote that I'm pondering:
### The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - Billie Eilish's [new album](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcf5pLcPbTwK?si=4jwUwWkDRPOMMnjX8aTUYg) is amazing and you should listen to it
    - I specifically like this live version of the song [wish you were gay](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HzUA4uLQZGi6hbrWd07uj?context=spotify%3Auser%3Aspotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1DXcf5pLcPbTwK&si=Dcq67wK6QHCJkaQ5wOPk2w) in the album
