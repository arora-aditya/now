I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

## What I'm doing now
- I'm trying to get a job, hoping and trying really hard to go to California
(Don't know how it's going to work out though)
- I'm preparing for interviews some Data Science, some Software Developer
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18
- I'm also preparing for midterms as part of my Computer Engineering major at UW
    - **ECE 222 - Digital Computers:** Currently stuck on understanding what Frame pointers are
    - **ECE 250 - Algorithms and Data Structures:** Have some knowledge of asymptomatic notation, so am going to see where I stand once I finish the assignment
    - **ECE 240 - Electronic Circuits 1:** Man oh man, I'm 2 weeks behind on this course, and it's killing me
    - **ECE 205 - Advanced Calculus 1:** One week behind, still need to catch up on an assignment
    - **ECE 290 - Engineering Profession, Ethics, and Law:** Although this course doesn't have a midterm I'm still due to submit a learning journal of the first 7 weeks of the course
    - **ECE 204 - Numerical Methods:** I don't know what is expected of me in this course, but I still have to finish reading the lecture notes
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- I'm sadly also watching all of Suits and damn do I love Mike's character! [sad because I have midterms to prepare for]
- Attached below is an email that motivates me to put myself first whenever I'm down or not feeling good! Hope you find it useful

A few days ago I received this email from [Yes Theory](https://yestheory.com/) titled `Be Selfish`

If you don't know who they are, you should look up why Will Smith jumped out of a helicopter, since they were the ones who challenged him to do it

After I read the 400 word email, I had goosebumps on my hands. This email gave me the urge to etch the message on my hand, to never forget it.

I've read the email about 5 times now, whenever I'm feeling low or down, I remember to be selfish to myself, to put myself first and to let it all go. I even sent this email to my mom just because of the effect it had on me.

Moreover, I am not one to reply to newsletters, but I made the exception, and just wanted to tell Matt (one of the members of the Yes Theory), how much the message had made me reflect. Even if I didn't reach him, I take pleasure in knowing that the message has been sent to the universe and that I did my part.

### Lesson learnt: `Be Selfish, but help others once you've reached where you have to be`
