I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

Sorry for the later than usual update, I went home for the holidays!

## What I'm doing now
- Have started working for [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI) as a Data Engineer and I am excited about how much I do not know!
- I've officially finished my URA with Prof. Karray, it was an easy gig but I would want to do something more hands on next term if possible!
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- Status of University in General:

_TBVH I got more marks than I expected and am very satisfied with what I've gotten._ **BUT** I am still exasperated by the fact that I was get by and get these marsks with 6 weeks of studying and 10 weeks of not studying in a 16 week term. I would honestly like to not do this since it is not great for those 6 weeks.
  - **ECE204**: Easiest course in 2A for me personally. All that was needed was to read the course notes and paraphrase them into my own and do all the practice problems in them which was honestly not a lot.
  - **ECE205**: Want to see my final, since I did not get as many marks as expected but honestly who can say!
  - **ECE222**: My concerns about wrecking the first question were soothed, since they were pretty lenient on the marking. Ended up getting pretty decent marks and happy about the whole course since this is more in line as to what I will be doing for the rest of my undergraduate!
  - **ECE240**: The exam went well. Pretty irritated at the fact that the prof refused to give me marks for a formula I used from the textbook that she didn't know about but that was in the readings.
  - **ECE250**: I got full marks in the question I predicted since they were pretty lenient on it. Ended up getting good marks and secured some more yesterday after looking at my final and getting some marks back!
  - **ECE290**: The final went decent considering the marks I got. Would still want to give it a look though, lets see if I can

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - [My Game mode playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/3V3HyBNyVSTz4gKNYcg8Iz?si=DgbcXr22T7ihYgsWQGYhOQ): It now has 21 songs on repeat so that I lose track of lyrics and can do some calculus
