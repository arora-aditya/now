## What I'm doing now
- Am gainfully employed for Winter 2019 as a Data Engineer [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI/)
  - Now looking for Fall 2019 Internships
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- Status of University in General:
  - **ECE204**: Haven't yet seen anything post midterm and have to catch up a lot!
  - **ECE205**: Have kept up due to assignments, thank god for those Conrad!
  - **ECE222**: Saw my midterm, but still would want to discuss it with my professor or at least a TA. Still need to work on my post-midterm stuff since I haven't really touched it
  - **ECE240**: Tried studying some part of it, but still need to catch up. Also have to study for a crazy 10% Lab Quiz
  - **ECE250**: Haven't studied a single word of this course, except for doing the projects.
  - **ECE290**: Will finish reading the 2 books by tonight and then start on the 10% book review by this weekend! [Most of time this week has gone to this]
- Finished Black Mirror, against the recommendation of someone to not watch it alone (because it messes with your head and sadly it did)
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
  - It's probably going to be Cancun since 2 of my really good friends have been planning this for a while
  - Or it might be somewhere with my family since this is my sister's last vacation in 2 years
