I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

## What I'm doing now
- Studying has started but I've been pre occupied with preparing for interview, and will have some catching up to do not too long into the term.
  - I am overloading the shit out of my term by taking an extra courses to bring my total up to 8 courses
    - 1 business courses, 1 economics course,  1 info session course, 1 prototyping (30hrs/term) course, 4 core courses
      - the ECON course has looked like a lot of memorization, while the business course seems like a lot of new interesting possibly difficult to memorize stuff.
      - the Business course is looking to be some very interesting class discussion given everyone reads the articles
      - ECE298(prototyping) is going well for the most part given we figure out how to prototype next week
      - ECE224 looks like a lot of digital circuit design and programming (and none of the defintions, which is what I was worried about) which in my opinion is a pretty good mix
      - ECE208 is going over the top of my head for now, but hopefully I can get in the assignment by the weekends
      - ECE252 looks to be really easy at the time of speaking, but I don't want to jinx myself yet. I'm having a lot of fun with the labs.
      - Have not really studied much of anything else
- Devoting some time to projects outside of work before applying to jobs next term [[sage](http://thesage.co/)/[waterlooworks2](https://waterlooworks2.com)]
- I have officially resigned from alI l forms of social media, and will not be giving the tech giants any more data into my browsing habits. No YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit or Google Plus (RIP)
  - Read my next book, Eric Schmidt's new book "The Trillion Dollar Coach", and will be writing the review (soon)
- I also somehow managed to squeeze in 9 seasons of `The Office` on Netflix in about a month, which is totally insane in my opinion

## Quote that I'm pondering:
### The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - Billie Eilish's [new album](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcf5pLcPbTwK?si=4jwUwWkDRPOMMnjX8aTUYg) is amazing and you should listen to it
    - I specifically like this live version of the song [wish you were gay](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HzUA4uLQZGi6hbrWd07uj?context=spotify%3Auser%3Aspotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1DXcf5pLcPbTwK&si=Dcq67wK6QHCJkaQ5wOPk2w) in the album
