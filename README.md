## What I'm doing now
Right now I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada.

## Nitty Gritty
- Studying has started but I've been pre occupied with preparing for interviews, and will have some catching up to do not too long into the term.
  - I am overloading the shit out of my term by taking an extra courses to bring my total up to 8 courses [1 business courses, 1 economics course,  1 info session course, 1 prototyping (~~30hrs/term~~) course, 4 core courses]
      - **ECON101**: I have my second midterm today, I'm hopeful but not too hopeful for a really good grade. Will have to revise some concepts before the midterm
      - **BET320**: The case study worth 25% went well, and I think so did the "midterm" but now I have to work with my group project also worth 25% due at the end of the term
      - **ECE298**: This course has been a world of pain. We (Me and my Lab partner) gave up on the actual "project" part of the course around 4 weeks ago, and have finally gotten something to work in the project. We submitted the PCB designs and Schematic before we had the project ready so its truly a sign of the gamble we were doing.
      - **ECE224**: I managed to attend a lot of the lectures, and I am glad I did so. It saved my midterm grade, but I missed one key lecture yesterday so have some catching up to do.
      - **ECE208**: My midterm grade was brutal because of the one mistake I made. I am going to do the Bonus Assignment completely to save my grade to some extent
      - **ECE252**: The midterm was fairly decent, and I have been caught up with class so things are looking good
      - **ECE207**: I am mostly ahead of the class, but really need to memorize some things to increase the pace of the problems I am doing.
- Devoting some time to projects outside of work before applying to jobs next term [[sage](http://thesage.co/)/[waterlooworks2](https://waterlooworks2.com)]
  - Work at Sage is going good, we have a couple of parallel projects running and I am able to devote some time over every weekend to keep things running
  - WaterlooWorks2 has been on hold except for the one long weekend where I made most of the List API backend. Most employers are showing great interest in this project so I am going to have to keep it up and maintain it well, but school has not given me enough time to do so
- Read my next book, Eric Schmidt's new book "The Trillion Dollar Coach", and will be writing the review (will probably have to skim through it again, when writing the review since its been a while)
