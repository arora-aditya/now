## What I'm doing now
- Am gainfully employed for Winter 2019 as a Data Engineer [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI/)
  - Now looking for Fall 2019 Internships
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- Status of University in General:
  - **ECE204**: Final went pretty decent, felt bad as I could've attended all lectures if he'd informed about it being open book from the start
  - **ECE205**: Have the final on Monday (17th Dec), studying for it as I type this
  - **ECE222**: Final went decent, except maybe the first question. Pretty satisfied overall by my understanding of this course except Frame pointers smh
  - **ECE240**: Gave up studying 2 days right before the final, literally just made my cheat sheet. Told my mom I'm getting a 60 and she was like even if you fail just don't burden yourself. The exam went surprisingly decent for the stress I was taking on myself
  - **ECE250**: Predicted one question in the Final, and shared it with 3 friends. They all thanked me :p I partially messed up though, should've read the whole question smh
  - **ECE290**: Have to read AQWF and MSM again, along with the other reference book and make notes on it
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
  - Cancun actually might have already fallen through, but I still want to go to some place really cool
  - Spain?
- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - [My Game mode playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/3V3HyBNyVSTz4gKNYcg8Iz?si=DgbcXr22T7ihYgsWQGYhOQ): It has ~12 songs on repeat so that I lose track of lyrics and can do some calculus
