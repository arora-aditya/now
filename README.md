## What I'm doing now
Right now I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, and currently doing an internship as a ~Software~ Everything Engineer at KitchenMate in Toronto. Day to day, I write SQL for PostgresQL, Node.js in CoffeeScript, and Angular in Jade as well as write design documents and code up things for a display.

- Finish reading "Everything is F*cked" by Mark Manson to see if it is any better than his last one, which ended on a meh note
  - still haven't finished this, very sad that I haven't been able to 
  - also goes to show that the book isn't as gripping
- Re-read Eric Schmidt's new book "The Trillion Dollar Coach", and and write the review

## Things I want to achieve
- Join driving school to actually get my G2 license
- Apply to jobs for the summer to avoid breaking my back in the study term
