I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

## What I'm doing now
Right now I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, and currently doing an internship as a ~Software~ Everything Engineer at KitchenMate in Toronto. Day to day, I write SQL for PostgresQL, Node.js in CoffeeScript, and Angular in Jade as well as write design documents and code up things for a display.

I've been working on some personal projects when I do manage to get the ball rolling.

I've been trying to level up in rust and have managed to make some sort of ray tracer with a lot of help from the tutorial and other resources. I'm now trying to make some sort of database, and improve the ray tracer but we will see how that goes.

I've also been trying to build out my own mood tracking app/website to avoid paying the 5 dollars for the Daylio app (but also to build a cool web project), but I don't actually know if this is going anywhere yet.

## Things I want to achieve
- ~Join driving school to actually get my G2 license~
- Get back into the reading game, Mark Ronson's book does not seem to be able to keep me engaged
- Apply to jobs for the summer to avoid breaking my back in the study term
