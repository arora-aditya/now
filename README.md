## What I'm doing now
- Am gainfully employed for Winter 2019 as a Data Engineer [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI/)
  - Now looking for Fall 2019 Internships
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- Midterms are all out now
  - **ECE204**: Did surprisingly well considering how un-related this course feels to me with respect to my overall Engineering degree
  - **ECE205**: Best, and most straight forward midterm
  - **ECE222**: Haven't actually seen my midterm yet, but feel that I could have actually done better
  - **ECE240**: Weird midterm since it was pretty much from the assignment, wished I could have done better here
  - **ECE250**: Happy, but disappointed at my expensive silly mistake in on one of the questions
- Watching Black Mirror, slowly at a one episode/week rate
- Made choley this week, they reminded me of home so much ðŸ˜‹
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
  - It's probably going to be Cancun since 2 of my really good friends have been planning this for a while
  - Or it might be somewhere with my family since this is my sister's vacation in 2 years (CBSE boards and all)
