[Just made it in time for my 2 weeks]

## What I'm doing now
- I'm trying to get a job, hoping and trying really hard to go to California
(Don't know how it's going to work out though)
- I'm preparing for interviews some Data Science, some Software Developer
  - Just wrecked on of the data science interview smh
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I finished with midterms now! Onto Finals now!
  - Will compare my midterm grades to effort spent  once I get them all
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- I finished all of Suits, don't really want to pick up on another show with midterms around the corner
  -  Did end up finishing 6 seasons of New Girl one week before my midterms smh
- I'm trying to learn to cook better, tried to make chicken this week, tasted pretty well
  - Nailed down the chicken recipe pretty well
  - Gonna try to make an indian dish this weekend
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
  - It's probably going to be Cancun since 2 of my really good friends have been planning this for a while
