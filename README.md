## What I'm doing now
Right now I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada.

## Nitty Gritty
- Prep for finals should be starting soon since I am 3 weeks out
  - I am overloading the shit out of my term by taking an extra courses to bring my total up to 8 courses [1 business courses, 1 economics course,  1 info session course, 1 prototyping (~~30hrs/term~~) course, 4 core courses]
      - **ECON101**: Finished both midterms, need to go over the new material taught since then and get the course ready for "final"
      - **BET320**: Have the group presentation worth 25% tomorrow. Hopefully all goes well
      - **ECE298**: Success! The PCB and schematic works and our project is ready for the demo tomorrow! Really looking forward to wrapping up one of my 7 courses.
      - **ECE224**: Haven't been able to focus in class because of house searching in Toronto, although I did record each and every lecture. All I have to do now is to sit through about 4.5 hours of lecture and make notes and study.
      - **ECE208**: Bonus Assignment is coming along well except for one question that I am planning to sit down and do today with Daniel. Need to *really* study post-midterm material to get me up to date.
      - **ECE252**: Missed one or two lectures because of house searching, planning to do get them over with this weekend.
      - **ECE207**: Behind class now, going to catch up today, and hopefully be on-par if not ahead.
- Devoting some time to projects outside of work before applying to jobs next term [[sage](http://thesage.co/)]
  - Work at Sage is going good, we have a project running and I am able to devote some time over every weekend to keep things running. Hopefully get that 100% wrapped up this weekend as well.

- Read my next book, Eric Schmidt's new book "The Trillion Dollar Coach", and will be writing the review (will probably have to skim through it again, when writing the review since its been a while)
