## What I'm doing now

- I have officially resigned from all forms of social media, and will not be giving the tech giants any more data into my browsing habits. No YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit or Google Plus (RIP)
  - UPDATE: the blog post on quitting social media is out: [How Quitting Social Media almost Cost me My Life
  - I also started a book blog (private at the moment will release details soon), but as part of that I'm reading the book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" and it has re-affirmed my commitment to be off social media

- Have started working for [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI) as a Data Engineer and I am excited about how much I do not know!
  - First two weeks were filled with me pestering my mentor to ask lots of questions that I lacked full context in
  - Third week (i.e. last week) was so much better since I was able to achieve so much more on my own and it was the best time ever
  - It was a very tumultuous 2 months, but last week was the first week that I actually got good feedback from my mentor.
  - I've been working on a huge multi-week (possibly multi-month) project to investigate the core logic behind everything the company does and suggest changes to it
  > Overall I am learning lots of Data Eng-y stuff, lots of new stuff in Python, lots of BigQuery SQL stuff


- Wanted to learn a few things this term:
  - Try to start getting some studying done before I get rekt by the study term
  - ~~Try to pick up on some Quant/Financial Skills~~
  - Learn how to file my own taxes to level up _adulting_
  - Start to get back on the study term pace by poking my fingers into the courses next term

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - Billie Eilish's [new album](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcf5pLcPbTwK?si=4jwUwWkDRPOMMnjX8aTUYg) is amazing and you should listen to it
  - My [mixed](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/7meRL9DLw9iwoT0FXkohSt?si=cuw0wVAFSW24286n4onP2A) playlist: It has 12 songs with similar tempo, and Hi-Fi beats to keep me going through the day
