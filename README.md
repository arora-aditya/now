## What I'm doing now
- I'm trying to get a job, hoping and trying really hard to go to California
(Don't know how it's going to work out though)
- I'm preparing for interviews some Data Science, some Software Developer
  - Just wrecked on of the data science interview smh
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I'm also preparing for midterms as part of my Computer Engineering major at UW
    - **ECE 222 - Digital Computers:** Now understood ARM ISA, but still have shit ton of practice to do. It's way better than what I thought of it earlier
    - **ECE 250 - Algorithms and Data Structures:** Did a good portion of the assignment, still need to cross reference with the professor's solutions to make sure I did them right. Still need to read up on all the different data structures tho
    - **ECE 240 - Electronic Circuits 1:** Tried catching up, still forgetful on OPAMPs but 2nd Order Circuits are way easier.
    - **ECE 205 - Advanced Calculus 1:** One week behind. Surprisingly the next assignment is based on next week's material. Plan to attend all lectures for this course in the coming weeks unless something extreme comes up.
    - **ECE 290 - Engineering Profession, Ethics, and Law:** Although this course doesn't have a midterm I'm still due to submit a learning journal of the first 7 weeks of the course. I'm working on that that as I write this.
    - **ECE 204 - Numerical Methods:** _Read a good portion of the lecture notes and even did some of the problems enclosed_ but still don't know on what and how I'm going to be tested on this
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- I finished all of Suits, don't really want to pick up on another show with midterms around the corner [Started on New Girl sadly, but am forgetting the Netflix Password from my browser right now!]
- I'm trying to learn to cook better, tried to make chicken this week, tasted pretty well
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
