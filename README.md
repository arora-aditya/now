I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

## What I'm doing now
- Have started working for [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI) as a Data Engineer and I am excited about how much I do not know!
> Overall I am learning lots of Data Eng-y stuff, lots of new stuff in Python, lots of BigQuery SQL stuff
  - First two weeks were filled with me pestering my mentor to ask lots of questions that I lacked full context in
  - Third week (i.e. last week) was so much better since I was able to achieve so much more on my own and it was the best time ever

- Wanted to learn a few things this term:
  - Try to pick up on some Quant/Financial Skills
  - Learn how to file my own taxes to level up _adulting_
  - Still need to keep up with my Technical Interview skills and hopefully level up before March

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - [Trust My Lonely by Alessia Cara](https://open.spotify.com/track/7eXT7U3FKrOM88xr1DsNwc?si=pGfcGU6zQNidEv2EUKgptg)
  - [My Game mode playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/3V3HyBNyVSTz4gKNYcg8Iz?si=DgbcXr22T7ihYgsWQGYhOQ): It now has ~21 songs on repeat so that I lose track of lyrics and can do some calculus
