I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

`Last Updated: March 19th 4:35pm EST`

Sorry for the late update, its been a frustrating ~2months

## What I'm doing now
- I have officially resigned from all forms of social media, and will not be giving the tech giants any more data into my browsing habits. No YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit or Google Plus (RIP)
  - This is the first time that I have gone to such extremes to actually curb my addictions and the blog post on the same is coming soon
- Have started working for [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI) as a Data Engineer and I am excited about how much I do not know!
> Overall I am learning lots of Data Eng-y stuff, lots of new stuff in Python, lots of BigQuery SQL stuff
  - First two weeks were filled with me pestering my mentor to ask lots of questions that I lacked full context in
  - Third week (i.e. last week) was so much better since I was able to achieve so much more on my own and it was the best time ever
  - It was a very tumultuous 2 months, but last week was the first week that I actually got good feedback from my mentor.
  - I've been working on a huge multi-week (possibly multi-month) project to investigate the core logic behind everything the company does and suggest changes to it

- Wanted to learn a few things this term:
  - ~~Try to pick up on some Quant/Financial Skills~~
  - Learn how to file my own taxes to level up _adulting_
  - Start to get back on the study term pace by poking my fingers into the courses next term

- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - I'm simply in love with [Billie Eilish](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/3pxaomF92bO7NsSBYO1QDj?si=No2gqZKNQceHalDoTOGaIw)
  - My [mixed](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya/playlist/7meRL9DLw9iwoT0FXkohSt?si=cuw0wVAFSW24286n4onP2A) playlist: It has 11 songs with similar tempo, and Hi-Fi beats to keep me going through the day
