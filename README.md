## What I'm doing now
- Am gainfully employed for Winter 2019 as a Data Engineer [@DraperAI](https://github.com/DraperAI/)
  - Now looking for Fall 2019 Internships
- I'm working for [Prof Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/karray) as a URA until December'18, it's going pretty slow to be very honest but am getting paid by term so I guess it's okay
- I'm trying to see how much I can take on in a single study term before I can't handle it anymore which is slightly hinting at the fact that I might be starting a startup with a good friend (the legality and specifics of which are undecided but we're sure as hell not stopping)
- Status of University in General:
  - **ECE204**: Tried studying a little bit but still have a fair amount to go. Since this is an open book exam, I have to write out a decent amount of notes.
  - **ECE205**: Have kept up due to assignments, thank god for those Conrad!
  - **ECE222**: Caught up a fair amount, but lacking some practice
  - **ECE240**: Got worse marks than expected in the lab quiz. Studied quite a bit, seems to be never ending. Still have the part about MOSFET amplifiers left, but hopefully get that done before next week
  - **ECE250**: Studying parallely right now, let's see how far I get
  - **ECE290**: Book review has been shaping up, I now have to study and memorize almost all the lecture slides. Hope to get some assistance on this from a friend
- Have not started any new TV series so I am liking the self control
- I'm also planning to go somewhere warm in the last week of April, so if you have any recommendations of somewhere not too expensive hit me up!
  - Cancun actually might have already fallen through, but I still want to go to some place really cool
- **Music I am listening to right now**:
  - Bille Eilish: [come out and play](https://open.spotify.com/track/7wC5eZcFS1Q1BsQ35DU6H4?si=MesFeeElRnW59vA4wJKziA)
  - Imagine Dragons: [Origins [Deluxe]](https://open.spotify.com/album/3JfSxDfmwS5OeHPwLSkrfr?si=MjOl9CTwSPKd2_hW4YrKDw)
  - Alexandre Desplat: [Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)](https://open.spotify.com/album/6eo8C94KmE7fQo9g0dd7de?si=-Bk7egDDSMWe6kSXOkEPyw)
