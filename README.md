## What I'm doing now

School has been popping off. I am busy with assignments, jobs and courses. Midterms are in ~1.5 weeks so its going to be a stressful reading week!

Have to get back working on a very basic [database](https://github.com/arora-aditya/database-in-one-week)

Have been still trying to keep the habit of doing leetcode contests every week, and its been fun and time intensive!

Currently reading [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501144316) on Bill Gates' recommendation, and its teaching me things about sleep that I am surprised are not public knowledge. 
Have been actively going to the gym 3 days a week, swimming on Saturday, have also been eating right and enough so 2020 is currently off to a great start! 

I have also been listening to some podcasts, and hopefully write a blog about them soon!

## Things I want to achieve
- Finished reading Blitzscaling - review coming soon
