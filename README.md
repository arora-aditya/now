I will try my best to keep this as updated as possible, do email me if I forget for over 2 weeks!

## What I'm doing now
Right now, I'm in Toronto as part of a co-op that I am wrapping up in 2 weeks.
This coop term has probably the term that I have had the most fun, finally got to get out of Waterloo, and meet new people and live in a city all by myself.
My role in itself has become integral to the company, so much so that they are actually looking for someone to take over all the work that I was doing on the data side of things as well as the embedded side of things.

I've been working on some personal projects when I do manage to get the ball rolling. Managed to build the [ray-tracer](https://github.com/arora-aditya/just-another-ray-tracer), currently working on a very basic [database](https://github.com/arora-aditya/database-in-one-week)s

I've been trying to level up in rust and have managed to make some sort of ray tracer with a lot of help from the tutorial and other resources. 

~I've also been trying to build out my own mood tracking app/website to avoid paying the 5 dollars for the Daylio app (but also to build a cool web project), but I don't actually know if this is going anywhere yet.~ The mood app clone is currently on hold since I simply fessed up the cash for that mood app, it might actually evolve to a "expense tracker" of sorts so that I can better manage expenses in the coming year

## Things I want to achieve
- Get back into the reading game, Mark Ronson's next book "Everything is F*cked" sucked pretty bad so I left it half-way. Started a new book, Blitz-scaling and have made significant strides in the same on my new kindle
